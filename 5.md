# Lesson 5

- Libraries/Modules
- While loops
- For loops



## Libraries/Modules

Modules are code that someone else made, that we can import into our code and use.

### Importing random

```py
import random
```

To import a specific property from a module
```py
from random import randint
```

To assign a pseudo-random number (from 0 - 64 inclusive) to a variable called number

```py
from random import randint

number = randinit(0, 64)
```

# While loops

```py
while True:
```

### Break

To stop a while loop from running, use ```break```
```py
while True:
  break
```

Looping and printing "Hello, World" until the variable number reaches five
```py
number = 0

while True:

  print("Hello, World")
  number += 1
  
  if number == 5:
    break
```

You can replace "True" with a boolean statement

```py
number = 0

while number < 5:
  print("Hello World")
  number += 1
```

One last examplme.

```py
number = 0

while number != 10:
  print(number)
  number += 1
```
